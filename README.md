_iOS Recruitment Challenge_

**Overview**
Create an iOS app which makes use of the following API: [https://swapi.dev/api/planets/](https://swapi.dev/api/planets/)

This will return a JSON list of planets.

Provide a list of recommendations for future features and improvements.

**Minimum Requirements**

· The application should have a screen which displays a list of planet names from the first page of planet data

· Planets should be persisted for offline viewing

· Minimum iOS version should be 15.0

· The app should be universal

· The app should be appropriately unit tested

· UIKit, SwiftUI, or a mix of both is fine.

· Code should be appropriately documented

· You do not have to load more than the first page of data

· Only use the standard Apple iOS frameworks, do not use any third-party libraries

If you are invited for an interview, part of that will involve expanding upon your solution to the challenge. Keep that in mind as you design your app.
